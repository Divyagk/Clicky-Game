- The app should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
